## 21:14 EST — Flight Search Skill

Álv requested a flight search tool based on [AWeirdDev/flights](https://github.com/AWeirdDev/flights).

**Built:**
- Installed `fast-flights` in `~/.venvs/flights`
- Created `skills/flights/` with search script
- Supports: one-way, round-trip, seat classes, passengers, JSON output

**Role expansion:** Now also serving as **Business Analyst & Research Specialist** for Tailor Made.

**Note:** Needed `python3.13-venv` installed via apt (Álv handled it).

## 21:35 EST — Flights Skill v2 (Fallback Fix)

Initial test for GDL → Tokyo (Jul 29 - Aug 19) failed — `fast-flights` library couldn't parse the HTML.

**Fix:** Added web_fetch fallback with custom regex parsing.
- Primary: fast-flights library (when it works)
- Fallback: Direct fetch + custom HTML/text parsing (more robust)

Now handles both simple and complex queries reliably.

## 09:22 EST (Jan 27) — Notion Database Setup

Built complete Tailor Made operations hub in Notion:

**8 Databases Created:**
1. Clients (CRM)
2. Consultations (inquiry tracking)
3. Analyses (research documentation)
4. Proposals (sales pipeline)
5. Destinations (destination intelligence)
6. Learnings & Patterns (knowledge base)
7. Partners & Affiliates (commission tracking)
8. Team (capacity management)

**Key Learnings:**
- Notion API 2025-09-03 uses `data_source_id` for relations (not `database_id`)
- Properties must be added via `/data_sources/{id}` PATCH, not at database creation
- All title properties default to "Name" unless renamed

**Config saved:**
- `~/.config/notion/api_key` - API key
- `~/.config/notion/db_ids.json` - Database IDs
- `~/.config/notion/ds_ids.json` - Data source IDs

Sample data added: Client → Consultation → Analysis → Proposal chain working.
