## Session Context
**Date:** Thursday, January 30, 2026
**User:** Álv (Rey)
**Mode:** Market Intelligence MVP Development

---

## Key Events

### 12:23 - Market Intelligence MVP Approval
Álv approved the Market Intelligence MVP plan:
- ✅ Daily tracking confirmed
- ✅ Weekly reports approved
- ✅ "Let's begin to build that!"

### 12:29 - Initial Build & Testing
Built `market_intel.py` CLI with:
- Flight price tracking for 6 routes (MEX→CUN, MIA, JFK, LAX, MAD, CDG)
- Exchange rate tracking (MXN vs USD, EUR, GBP)
- Weekly report generation with trend analysis
- Telegram-formatted output

Tested successfully - prices fetched from Amadeus API.

### 12:53 - Moved to Separate Repo (per Álv request)
Álv: "market intelligence should be on its own repo"

Created `/home/clawdbot/market-intelligence`:
- Standalone Git repository
- `scripts/market_intel.py` - Main CLI tool
- `data/market-intel/` - JSON data storage
- `scripts/cron-daily-flights.sh` - Daily tracking cron
- `scripts/cron-weekly-report.sh` - Weekly report cron
- README.md with usage instructions

Configured crontab:
- Daily flight tracking: 14:00 UTC (~8am Mexico City)
- Weekly report: Mondays 15:00 UTC (~9am Mexico City)

### 12:55 - Commits
- **market-intelligence repo**: Initial commit (91614c3)
- **clawd repo**: Moved market intel to separate repo (e0388ab)

### 13:48 - Notion Integration Request
Álv: "will report be stored in notion?"

**Decision:** Create separate "Market Intelligence" database

**Reasoning:**
- Separation of concerns: BI data vs one-off client analyses
- Specialized schema needed for routes, currencies, trends, insights
- Scalability for future metrics
- Clean queries without cluttering Operations DB

### 13:52 - Confirmed to Proceed
Álv: "Yes, please, let's store all data and reports on notion so it can be accesible"

### 13:53 - OpenCode Failed, Direct Implementation
OpenCode failed (Fireworks AI account suspended - billing limit)

Álv: "ok, go option 2" (implement directly)

**Implemented:**
- Added Notion client to `market_intel.py`
- Created save functions:
  - `save_daily_prices_to_notion()` - 6 route entries per day
  - `save_exchange_to_notion()` - 3 currency entries per day
  - `save_weekly_report_to_notion()` - 1 entry per week
- Added `--notion` flag to enable/disable Notion saving
- Updated cron scripts with `--notion` flag
- Created `data/notion-db-ids.json` for database ID config
- Updated README.md with Notion setup instructions
- Created `scripts/setup_notion.py` helper

### 14:02 - Tested Successfully
```bash
python scripts/market_intel.py track --type flights --notion  # Works
python scripts/market_intel.py report --days 7 --notion      # Works
```

**Commit:** cdfbfc2 - Add Notion integration for market intelligence
