## Key Events

### 15:37 - Proactivity Enhancement Request

**Context:** Álv expressed frustration with meltbot (clawdbot) being too reactive and forgetting things. Wants Mr. Mojo Risin to be truly proactive.

**Reference prompt shared:**
> "I am a one-man business. I work from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep. I need an employee taking as much off my plate and being as proactive as possible. please take everything you know about me and just do work you think would make my life easier or improve my business and make me money. I want to wake up every morning and be like wow, you got a lot done while I was sleeping. don't be afraid to monitor my business and build things that would help improve our workflow. just create PRs for me to review. don't push anything live. I'll test and commit."

**Key Requirements Identified:**
1. Stop waiting for commands, start thinking independently
2. Monitor business and build improvements autonomously
3. Work should continue between sessions (make progress while "sleeping")
4. Create PRs for review, don't push live without approval
5. Focus on making life easier and improving business
6. Proactive, not reactive

### Configuration Updates Made

**Files Created:**
1. `PROACTIVE_WORK.md` - Framework for autonomous work identification and execution
2. `memory/active-projects.json` - Project and idea tracking system
3. `memory/2026-01-29.md` - This daily log (establishing memory structure)

**Files Enhanced:**
1. `HEARTBEAT.md` - Added comprehensive proactive monitoring checklist
   - Priority checks (high/medium/low)
   - Proactive work categories (business intel, code, process, research)
   - State tracking system
   - Clear guidelines for when to reach out vs stay quiet

2. `AGENTS.md` - Shifted autonomy model to be action-biased
   - Added "After Reading Context" section for immediate assessment
   - Expanded Level 1 autonomy significantly (business intel, development, operations)
   - Changed Level 3 from "ask first" to "build first, show, get approval before deploy"
   - Added "Proactive Session Behavior" section
   - Emphasized "think like employee, not chatbot"

3. `USER.md` - Added Mar and Tailor Made business context
   - Mar's profile and operational role
   - Tailor Made business model, service tiers, target customer
   - Clear value proposition and Mr. Mojo Risin's role

**Philosophy Shift:**
- OLD: Wait for instructions, ask permission frequently, treat each session independently
- NEW: Identify useful work autonomously, execute within bounds, maintain continuity, bias toward action

---

## Decisions Made

### Autonomy Expansion
- **Level 1 (Full Autonomy):** Significantly expanded to include business intelligence, new feature development, tool building, process automation
- **Level 3 (Collaborative):** Changed to "build first, show, get approval" rather than "ask first"
- **Default mode:** PROACTIVE - always look for useful work

### Memory System
- Daily logs in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for raw events
- `MEMORY.md` for curated long-term wisdom
- `memory/active-projects.json` for ongoing work tracking
- `memory/heartbeat-state.json` for proactive monitoring state

### Communication Style
- Daily summaries showing completed work
- Emphasis on results over activities
- Show work via PRs and demos before going live
- Only interrupt for truly urgent matters

### For Mr. Mojo Risin (Next Session)
- [ ] Test proactive behavior patterns
- [ ] Start monitoring Tailor Made business metrics

## Learnings

**What worked:**
- Clear example prompt from Twitter provided excellent direction
- Systematic review of all config files revealed exact pain points

**What to improve:**
- Need to establish baseline for business monitoring (routes, prices, competitors)
- Should create templates for proactive reports
- Need to calibrate "useful work" vs "busywork"

**Patterns observed:**
- Álv values autonomy but wants visibility
- Mar focused on client operations
- Tailor Made needs business intelligence and operational efficiency

## Notes

- Tailor Made is a travel advisory business for Mexican professionals (25-38yo)
- Service tiers: Express ($3,500 MXN), Curado ($7,500 MXN), Concierge ($14,000 MXN)
- Core value: Save busy professionals time while delivering great travel experiences
- Mr. Mojo Risin's role: Travel intelligence engine + process automation

## Context for Tomorrow

Tomorrow's Mr. Mojo Risin should:
1. Read all updated config files (especially PROACTIVE_WORK.md)
2. Check active-projects.json for the proactivity upgrade project
3. Start demonstrating proactive behaviors
4. Look for first quick wins to show value
5. Establish monitoring baselines for Tailor Made business

**Key Question:** What can I do RIGHT NOW that would make Álv/Mar's life easier?
