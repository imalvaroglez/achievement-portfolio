---

## Key Events

### 11:03 - Session Start (Gateway Restart Recovery)

**Context:** Álv restarted gateway entirely, restored .md files manually. Fresh session.

**Actions taken:**
- Read all context files (SOUL, USER, AGENTS, MEMORY, etc.)
- Committed all workspace files to GitHub (`at-tailor-made/clawdbot`)
- Set git identity: "Mr. Mojo Risin" <mojo@tailormade.mx>
- Merged `origin/main` into `master` (had full Amadeus skill history)
- Resolved conflicts keeping restored .md files (latest)
- Pushed everything clean

### 12:40 - Code Sync from GitHub

Pulled all existing code from `origin/main` branch:
- Full Amadeus API skill (flights, hotels, POI, price analysis, Notion integration)
- 16 atomic commits from Jan 28 implementation sessions
- Skills: flights (fast-flights), amadeus, tailor-made

### 13:05 - Refactor & Integration Planning

**Álv's request:** Refactor `skills/flights/` to use Amadeus API instead of fast-flights (Google scraper = legal risk for business). Complete the workflow integration.

**Plan agreed:**
1. Phase 1: Replace fast-flights backend with Amadeus in flights skill
2. Phase 2: Unified travel research command (shared Amadeus lib)
3. Phase 3: End-to-end workflow (RÁPIDO + PROFUNDO + Notion auto-doc)
4. Phase 4: Cleanup (remove fast-flights, update docs, PR)

### 13:11 - Major Business Context from Álv

**Two Telegram accounts:**
- `80059078` (@aalorv9) → Álv — strategic, development
- TBD (Tailor Made) → Operations — client work, Mar support

**RNT Status:** Mar working on Registro Nacional de Turismo (legal agency registration in Mexico)

**Provider Commissions:** Already onboarded with travel providers offering commission on package sales. Need to understand inventory and integrate.

**Market Intelligence Request:** Álv wants strategies for leveraging market trends. Proposed 7 approaches:
1. Price Pattern Engine (Amadeus historical data)
2. Google Trends Monitor (destination interest from Mexico)
3. Competitor Intelligence (3-5 key competitors)
4. Exchange Rate Alerts (MXN vs travel currencies)
5. Route & Airline News (new flights, promos)
6. Social Listening (travel hashtags, influencer trends)
7. Provider Inventory Optimization (compare provider vs open market)

**Updated Phase Plan:**
- Phases 1-4: Flights skill refactor (immediate)
- Phase 5: Provider integration (pending details)
- Phase 6: Market intelligence system
- Phase 7: Commission tracking in Notion

## Pending Information Needed
- [ ] Which travel providers are they onboarded with?
- [ ] Provider inventory access (API? Portal? Manual?)
- [ ] Commission structure details
- [ ] Tailor Made Telegram account connection

## Previous Context (from earlier session today)

### 15:37 - Proactivity Enhancement Request (earlier today, pre-restart)

**Context:** Álv identified that previous behavior was too reactive and forgetful.

**Key Requirements:**
1. Stop waiting for commands, start thinking independently
2. Monitor business and build improvements autonomously
3. Work should continue between sessions
4. Create PRs for review, don't push live without approval
5. Focus on making life easier and improving business

**Files Created/Enhanced:**
- `PROACTIVE_WORK.md`, `memory/active-projects.json`, `memory/heartbeat-state.json`
- Enhanced: HEARTBEAT.md, AGENTS.md, USER.md

---

## Context for Next Session

1. Flights skill refactor in progress (Phase 1)
2. Waiting for provider details from Álv
3. Market intelligence strategy approved conceptually
4. Two-account setup understood, TM account not yet connected
