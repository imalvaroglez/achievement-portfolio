# Daily Log - 2026-01-29

## Session Context
**Date:** Wednesday, January 29, 2026
**User:** Álv (Rey)
**Mode:** Configuration & Refinement → Development Planning

---

## Key Events

### 11:03 - Session Start (Gateway Restart Recovery)

**Context:** Álv restarted gateway entirely, restored .md files manually. Fresh session.

**Actions taken:**
- Read all context files (SOUL, USER, AGENTS, MEMORY, etc.)
- Committed all workspace files to GitHub (`at-tailor-made/clawdbot`)
- Set git identity: "Mr. Mojo Risin" <mojo@tailormade.mx>
- Merged `origin/main` into `master` (had full Amadeus skill history)
- Resolved conflicts keeping restored .md files (latest)
- Pushed everything clean

### 12:40 - Code Sync from GitHub

Pulled all existing code from `origin/main` branch:
- Full Amadeus API skill (flights, hotels, POI, price analysis, Notion integration)
- 16 atomic commits from Jan 28 implementation sessions
- Skills: flights (fast-flights), amadeus, tailor-made

### 13:05 - Refactor & Integration Planning

**Álv's request:** Refactor `skills/flights/` to use Amadeus API instead of fast-flights (Google scraper = legal risk for business). Complete the workflow integration.

**Plan agreed:**
1. Phase 1: Replace fast-flights backend with Amadeus in flights skill
2. Phase 2: Unified travel research command (shared Amadeus lib)
3. Phase 3: End-to-end workflow (RÁPIDO + PROFUNDO + Notion auto-doc)
4. Phase 4: Cleanup (remove fast-flights, update docs, PR)

### 13:11 - Major Business Context from Álv

**Two Telegram accounts:**
- `80059078` (@aalorv9) → Álv — strategic, development
- TBD (Tailor Made) → Operations — client work, Mar support

**RNT Status:** Mar working on Registro Nacional de Turismo (legal agency registration in Mexico)

**Provider Commissions:** Already onboarded with travel providers offering commission on package sales. Need to understand inventory and integrate.

**Market Intelligence Request:** Álv wants strategies for leveraging market trends. Proposed 7 approaches:
1. Price Pattern Engine (Amadeus historical data)
2. Google Trends Monitor (destination interest from Mexico)
3. Competitor Intelligence (3-5 key competitors)
4. Exchange Rate Alerts (MXN vs travel currencies)
5. Route & Airline News (new flights, promos)
6. Social Listening (travel hashtags, influencer trends)
7. Provider Inventory Optimization (compare provider vs open market)

**Updated Phase Plan:**
- Phases 1-4: Flights skill refactor (immediate)
- Phase 5: Provider integration (pending details)
- Phase 6: Market intelligence system
- Phase 7: Commission tracking in Notion

---

## Pending Information Needed
- [ ] Which travel providers are they onboarded with?
- [ ] Provider inventory access (API? Portal? Manual?)
- [ ] Commission structure details
- [ ] Tailor Made Telegram account connection

## Previous Context (from earlier session today)

### 15:37 - Proactivity Enhancement Request (earlier today, pre-restart)

**Context:** Álv identified that previous behavior was too reactive and forgetful.

**Key Requirements:**
1. Stop waiting for commands, start thinking independently
2. Monitor business and build improvements autonomously
3. Work should continue between sessions
4. Create PRs for review, don't push live without approval
5. Focus on making life easier and improving business

**Files Created/Enhanced:**
- `PROACTIVE_WORK.md`, `memory/active-projects.json`, `memory/heartbeat-state.json`
- Enhanced: HEARTBEAT.md, AGENTS.md, USER.md

---

### 13:16 - Phase 1 Complete: Flights Skill Refactor
- Replaced fast-flights (Google scraper) with Amadeus API backend
- `skills/flights/scripts/search_flights.py` now uses shared `skills/amadeus/lib/`
- Same CLI interface, proper licensed GDS data
- Committed: `ddae70a`

### 13:28 - Phase 2 Complete: Unified Travel Research CLI
- Created `skills/amadeus/scripts/travel_research.py`
- Single entry point: flights, hotels, poi, airports, research (combined)
- All commands output consistent JSON with metadata
- Research command combines flights + hotels + optional Notion
- Updated SKILL.md documentation
- Committed: `ca21ca6`

### 13:36 - Phase 3 Complete: Workflow Engine + Notion
- Created `skills/tailor-made/scripts/workflow.py`
- RÁPIDO mode: Quick 2-3 option analysis, budget insight, Telegram-ready
- PROFUNDO mode: Comprehensive 5-option analysis, cost breakdown, recommendation
- Notion auto-documentation: Creates entries in Operations + Proposals DBs
- Fixed Notion DB issues: old `db_ids.json` databases were archived
- Discovered active DBs: operations (`2f7a81f6-c8ba-801b-bb52-dae3895517ee`), proposals (`2f7a81f6-c8ba-8026-b70b-fcf4e9e9549f`)
- Added `NOTION_API_KEY` to gateway env vars
- All tested and working end-to-end
- Committed: `f8e9d9a`

### Notion Database Status
- `db_ids.json` DBs (Analyses, Proposals, etc.) → **ARCHIVED** — don't use
- `ds_ids.json` DBs → **404 / not shared** with integration — don't use
- Active DBs found via search: `operations` and `proposals` — **USE THESE**

### 13:43 - Standing Autonomy Instruction from Álv
**"If I don't answer for 1+ hour (except 11pm-7am CST), continue on your own. Never merge to main — leave PRs and I'll check ASAP. Never stop doing things or wait for me."**

This is now the default operating mode.

## Context for Next Session

1. **Phase 4 in progress:** Cleanup (remove fast-flights dep, final PR to main)
2. Waiting for provider details from Álv
3. Market intelligence strategy approved conceptually
4. Two-account setup understood, TM account not yet connected
5. All 3 core phases (flights refactor, unified CLI, workflow engine) DONE
6. Branch: `feature/flights-amadeus-refactor` — ready for final cleanup + PR
7. **Autonomy mode:** Keep working, never merge, leave PRs for review
