## Amadeus API Integration Proposal

**Context:** Álv researching travel APIs for Tailor Made's proposal workflow. Evaluated Amadeus vs Duffel.

**Decision:** Amadeus selected for:
- Broader airline/hotel coverage
- Industry-standard GDS data
- Better for research/insight use case (not booking)
- Free tier available for testing

**Deliverable:** Created comprehensive skill proposal at `docs/proposals/amadeus-skill-proposal.md`

**Scope includes:**
- Flight search & price analysis
- Hotel search
- Points of Interest
- Full security & compliance documentation

**Next steps:**
1. ~~Álv to register at Amadeus for Developers~~ ✅ Done
2. ~~Begin skill implementation once credentials available~~ ✅ In Progress

## Amadeus Skill Implementation - Phase 1 Complete

**Status:** Core infrastructure + Flight APIs implemented and tested

**Completed:**
- `lib/auth.py` - OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow with auto-refresh
- `lib/client.py` - High-level API client with caching
- `lib/cache.py` - In-memory TTL cache (15 min default)
- `scripts/flights/search_flights.py` - Flight offers search
- `scripts/flights/find_airports.py` - Airport/city lookup
- `SKILL.md` - Skill documentation

**Verified working:**
- Test credentials configured in `~/.clawdbot/config.yaml`
- Airport search: "Barcelona" → BCN (Josep Tarradellas)
- Flight search: BCN→JFK 2026-03-15 returning ~€277/person economy

**Remaining Phase 1:**
- Hotel search scripts
- Points of Interest scripts
- IATA codes reference doc

**Open questions flagged:**
- Notion integration for proposals?
- Multi-currency support?
- Caching strategy (Redis vs in-memory)?
